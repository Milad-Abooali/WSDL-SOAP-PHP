# WSDL/SOAP Sample (PHP)

This is very simple example of running SOAP server in PHP for WSDL.

There is only 1 function included for test.
However you can extend this sample as you need, but this is not the best solution for big WSDL server.

You may check out for dynamic generated .wsdl files from php class to find out better solutions.

# Usage

1. Place server folder on your www and edit lin 67 of demo.wsdl (to change the path if need).

2. use the file in client folder to call SOAP server, you have to change the SOAP server URL on line 2.

# Notice

This is just a simple example to understand how SOAP server and WSDL combination in PHP.
You need be care about usage of this sample in action (real projects).

Feedback is welcome,
